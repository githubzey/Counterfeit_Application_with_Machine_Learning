# Counterfeit_Application_with_Machine_Learning

I made this application for a project during my formation Data Analyst OpenClassrooms  and I used the dataset that given by the formation center.
The dataset that you see in data folder is the dataset that i cleaned and prepared for application.
You can test application in this [link](https://githubzey-counterfeit-application-with-machine-lear-main-mejdlr.streamlit.app/) and you can use the "billets_production.csv" file for test the application.
Have fun !
